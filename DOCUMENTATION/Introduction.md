# INTRODUCTION
Okay, so you've decided that you want to modify Exospace.
Now what?

Well, that's where this documentation comes in.

Because the game comes with functions ("My Blocks" to those who mainly use Scratch)
with 'helpful' names like "SETTINGS :D (it's 3 am)", I think I should explain.

Each main folder represents one Scratch sprite.
This folder (the "DOCUMENTATION" folder) contains those folders and general, basic stuff.
