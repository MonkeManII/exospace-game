# New to Scratch? Start Here! [CHAPTER 0]
Okay, so this guide assumes that you've written in some other language like Javascript, Typescript, Python, Lua, C#, etc.
So, what's the deal with Scratch? What makes it so annoying?
For starters...

### DATA STRUCTURES.

Unlike actual languages, Scratch is meant as an introduction.

For whatever reason, this means that...
- Temporary variables do not exist.
- Functions cannot return values.
- Only strings, booleans, and numbers can be represented by the orange variable blocks.
- Only arrays can be represented by the scarlet variable blocks.

So, how does this work?
Basically, arrays act in place of classes, etc.

Instead of:

```
// JS
let item = {
    name: "Iron Pickaxe",
    toolTag: "pickaxe",
    properties: {
        maxDurability: 100,
        durability: 75
    }
}
```

...which is simple, elegant, and readable, you have to do a really, *really* hacky workaround.
